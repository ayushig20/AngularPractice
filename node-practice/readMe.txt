3-> Singleton Design Pattern.(Creational)
4-> Factory Design Pattern.(Creational)
5-> Bridge design pattern.(Behavioral)
6-> Abstract Factory Design Pattern.(Creational )

Type of Design Pattern:

Creational 
Class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.
example:: Creational design patterns are Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool and Prototype.

Structural
Organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.
example :: Structural design patterns are Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data and Proxy.

Behavioral
Identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
example :: Behavioral patterns are Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor

example:: Creational design patterns are Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool and Prototype.

Structural
Organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.
example :: Structural design patterns are Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data and Proxy.

Behavioral
Identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
example :: Behavioral patterns are Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor
